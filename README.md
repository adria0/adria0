Hi!

I'm the Organizer of the [Barcelona Ethereum Developers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/ethereumbcn/), and now I'm working in the [Ethereum Foundation zkEVM](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits)

Some projects I am in some way proud are a [Circom compiler](https://github.com/adria0/za) and the [Secure Scuttlebutt libaries](https://github.com/kuska-ssb), both in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), anyway take a look at the [CV](https://github.com/adria0/cv) for more.
