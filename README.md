Hi!

I'm the Organizer of the [Barcelona Ethereum Developers Meetup](https://ethbcn.dev/). 

Some projects I am in some way proud are a [Circom compiler](https://github.com/adria0/za) and the [Secure Scuttlebutt libaries](https://github.com/kuska-ssb), both in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), anyway take a look at the [CV](https://adria0.github.io/cv/) for more.
