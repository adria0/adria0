Hi!

I'm the Organizer of the [Barcelona Ethereum Developers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/ethereumbcn/), and now I'm working in the [Ethereum Foundation zkEVM](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits)

At this moment I like [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), last projects I did are: a [Circom compiler in rust](https://github.com/adria0/za) and the [Secure Scuttlebutt libaries](https://github.com/kuska-ssb). Take a look to the [awesome-halo2](https://github.com/adria0/awesome-halo2) repo if you're buliding on this.
